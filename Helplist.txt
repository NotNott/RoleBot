I do this stuff if you say '!' and got permission. Everythings limited to a length of two. 
create - Create Role for server 
give - Add Role by role @username
add - Add Role to self
take - Removes Role by role @username
remove - Removes Role from self
list - Lists available Roles
delete - Deletes Role from server
perm - Give Role permissions to a Role
The rest give roles colors
Red
Blue
Green
Yellow
Pink

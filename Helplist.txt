I do this stuff if you say '!' and got permission. Everythings limited to a length of two. 
crole - Create Role for server 
arole - Add Role by role @username
parole - Add Role to self
rrole - Removes Role by role @username
prrole - Removes Role from self
frole - Lists available Roles
drole - Deletes Role from server
